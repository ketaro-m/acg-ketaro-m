![preview](preview.png)

**Deadline: May 5th (Thu) at 15:00pm**

----

## Before Doing Assignment

If you have not done the [task00](../task00), do it first to set up the C++ graphics developtment environment.

Follow [this document](../doc/submit.md) to submit the assignment, In a nutshell, before doing the assignment,  
- make sure you synchronized the `main ` branch of your local repository  to that of remote repository.
- make sure you created branch `task02` from `main` branch.
- make sure you are currently in the `task02` branch (use `git branch -a` command).

Now you are ready to go!

## Problem 1

1. Build the code using cmake
2. Run the code
3. Take a screenshot image (looks like image at the top)
4. Save the screenshot image overwriting `task02/problem1.png`
 
<img src="problem1.png" width="400">


## Problem 2

Write some code (about 5 ~ 7  lines) around `line #25` in `shader.vert` 
to define the coordinate transformation of equidistant fisheye lens.
Read the instruction in the `shader.vert` for more information.

Save the screenshot image overwriting `task02/problem2.png`
