## Before Doing Assignment

If you have not done the [task00](../task00), do it first to set up the C++ graphics development environment.

Follow [this document](../doc/submit.md) to submit the assignment, In a nutshell, before doing the assignment,  
- make sure you synchronized the `main ` branch of your local repository  to that of remote repository.
- make sure you created branch `task06` from `main` branch.
- make sure you are currently in the `task06` branch (use `git branch -a` command).


This assignment needs [tinygltf](https://github.com/syoyo/tinygltf) library. Download it with

```bash
$ cd acg-<username>
$ git submodule update --init external/tinygltf
```

Now you are ready to go!
